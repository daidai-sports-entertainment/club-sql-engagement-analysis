# club-sql-engagement-analysis

**context**

Here at the League, 32 clubs use our fan engagement datasets daily for internal operations, marketing, and ticket sales. Part of my job is to understand:
1. What data is being used and how, so I can relay insights to data engineers to help improve the tables.
2. Who is using our data, in what way, and for what kinds of analytical projects, so we can better understand their goals and be prepared to consult them with relevant datasets, use cases, and best practices.
3. The overall usage of our data, which is one of the most important KPIs for our department. My stakeholders use insights from the usage report to promote and update the Fan 1:1 program in League steer-co meetings with the 32 club owners.

In short, understanding club data usage is critical. Both externally, to ensure we continue delivering the best data in the industry, and internally, to drive adoption of the Fan 1:1 program among ownership (especially thanks to the revenue share structure between the League and 32 clubs).
