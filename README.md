# club-sql-engagement-analysis


Here at the League, 32 clubs are using our fan engagement datasets on a daily basis for their internal operation, marketing, and ticketing sales purposes. Part of my job is to understand 
1. what and how are datasets being leveraged by clubs, so I can pass the insights to data engineers to keep improving the table
2. who are using our club, in what way, and what their analytical project look like, so we know what analytcial goals they had in mind so we are prepared to consult them with our datest/use case/best practices.
3. the overall usage of our dataset, which is one of the most important KPIs of our department. My stakeholders use the insights generated from usage report to promote/update the fan 1:1 program to 32 clubs owner in the League steer-co meeting.

In short, understanding clubs data usage in extremely important both externally how we keep provide the best data in the indsutry to clubs, and also internally how we keep pushing the adoption of our fan 1:1 program to owners.
